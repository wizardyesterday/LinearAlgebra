This repository contains all computer problems as described by the book
entitled "Introduction to Linear Algebra, 5th Edition" by Gilbert Strang.
His book talks about using MATLAB, Python, and Julia.  I chose to use
Scilab since I'm quite familiar with that language.

I'm not sure how many computer problems are specified in the book, but, I
believe that it's worth making a repository of this stuff.

I decided to port the MATLAB Teaching codes into Scilab.  The original URL is
http://web.mit.edu/18.06/www/Course-Info/Tcodes.html.
I have also added a doc directory that contains pdf and postscript
representations of the above mentioned web page.

I created a papers directory that contains published papers, not necessrily
my own works.
