This repository contains all computer problems as described by the book
entitled "Introduction to Linear Algebra, 5th Edition" by Gilbert Strang.
His book talks about using MATLAB, Python, and Julia.  I chose to use
Scilab since I'm quite familiar with that language.

I'm not sure how many computer problems are specified in the book, but, I
believe that it's worth making a repository of this stuff.
